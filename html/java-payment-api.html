                        Usually I work with front-end, as it's visually appealing, but something about the pure functionality of a sql server and command-line application attracts me.</br>
                        This project was intended to be functionally similar to Venmo

                        Using Rest, Spring Boot, Java, and PSQL, this project included both a server-side and client-side application to allow users to access their information from the server and only theirs.</br>
                        This project was only built to be used locally and sadly doesn't allow for web queries, but the framework to make it public is in place.

                        This was surprisingly straight-forward to set up. I had to implement Data Access Objects as well as SQL DAOs for all the classes I wanted to send over HTTP, but after that and adding a server rest controller, there was surprisingly little left to do.

                        People around me had portfolios. Online ones, applications, documents... Apparently you can get very creative when documenting everything you do, but I didn't have one.</br>
                        Something I haven't seen yet is someone creating their own web server (pictured)

                        I had a little Raspberri Pi 3 sitting around for years because I couldn't find a use for it. It was cool to have a second computer running linux but it wasn't <i>useful.</i> So instead of having it collect dust on my desk, I put
                        it to work. I installed apache 2, bought this domain for $0.89, and coded this site manually because I can and I felt like it.

                        I poked around on hostinger to find a domain that fit my brand and settled on jamfactory.tech. After this, I set up port triggering on my home router, set up the apache port, and added nameservers to match my public IP on hostinger.</br>
                        Then I got to work making my site. Nothing fancy, just me, VS Code, and github.
